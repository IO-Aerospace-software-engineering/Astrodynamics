KPL/PCK

      The mkspk application needs the data in this kernel to produce
      type 10 SPK segments based upon the two-line element sets available
      from NORAD/SPACETRACK. The data applies ONLY to the Two Line Element 
      sets and only to the SGP4 implementations included 
      in the SPICE library [1][2]. Mkspk copies this data to the constants
      partition of the type 10 segment, so the user has no need for the kernel
      after creation of the corresponding SPK.

      The assigned values are taken from the Spacetrack #3 report, refered
      to as WGS721 in Vallado [2]. It is possible to edit this file
      to use the high accuracy WGS-72 values (WGS72) or the WGS-84 
      values (WGS84). The KE parameter value for WGS72 and WGS84
      is calulated from the MU and ER values. The lists include MU only
      for the calculation of KE.

      The first 3 numbers are the un-normalized zonal harmonic values 
      for the earth. These numbers are dimensionless.
